**rivt** is a Python package that provides a calculation API for **rivt**.
The API is file and folder based with a specified folder and naming convention.
The file, folder and prefix naming (italic shows optional) divide the
calculation report into modular, easily edited and shareable components. The
naming structure is also used to assemble calcs into a collated report. Folders
are shown bracketed and notes are in parenthesis.
